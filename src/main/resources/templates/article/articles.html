		<h1>1. Understanding Services</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet"> What is a Borewell?</h2>
		<p>
			A <strong>borewell</strong> is a deep, narrow hole drilled into the ground to access groundwater for various
			uses like drinking, irrigation, or industrial needs.
			It is created using drilling machines, and a pipe (called <em>casing</em>) is installed to protect the water
			source and support the structure.
		</p>

		<p>
			Borewells are a common solution in areas where surface water is limited. The depth of a borewell can range
			from
			<strong>100 to 1200 feet</strong>, depending on the underground water level. A <strong>submersible
				pump</strong> is usually installed inside the borewell
			to lift water to the surface.
		</p>

		<h2 class="bullet"> Types of Borewell Drilling Methods</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="highlight">DTH (Down-The-Hole):</span> Suitable for hard rock areas, uses a hammering
				action to break rocks.</li>
			<li><span class="highlight"><strIn-well:< /span> In this method, the drilling vehicle is parked 150–200 feet
						away
						from the actual borewell location due to space or access limitations. Flexible hoses or rods are
						extended from the vehicle to the drilling spot, making it suitable for areas like narrow plots,
						inside
						farms, or residential locations with limited access.</li>
			<li><span class="highlight">Rotary:</span> Used in soft or sandy formations, involves continuous rotation
				and drilling mud.</li>
			<li><span class="highlight">Calyx:</span> Older method used for large diameter and deep wells with specific
				geological needs.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet"> Choosing the Right Location</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The success of a borewell largely depends on selecting a proper location. It is important to choose
				a <strong>clear and open area </strong>for drilling, where there are <strong>no underground chambers,
					drainage pipelines, or
					water tanks</strong> above or near the spot. These obstructions can damage equipment or affect the
				borewell structure.
				Avoid drilling near septic tanks or foundations, and ensure there's enough space for the boring vehicle
				and equipment to operate smoothly.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet"> How to Choose the Right Borewell Contractor</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Choosing the right borewell contractor is one of the most critical steps in ensuring the success of your
				borewell.
				Since drilling involves technical expertise, high-end machinery, and considerable investment, the
				contractor you
				select will have a direct impact on the outcome. Here are three important factors to consider:</li>
			<li><span class="highlight">Experience:</span> An experienced contractor brings both knowledge and practical
				exposure to the job.
				Borewell drilling is not just about operating a machine; it requires understanding soil types, rock
				layers, and the water table.
				Contractors who have worked in your locality or similar terrains usually know the common depths where
				water can be struck
				and the challenges that may arise during drilling. Always ask about the contractor’s years of service
				and request a list of
				projects they have handled in your area.</li>
			<li><span class="highlight">Equipment:</span> Modern borewell drilling relies heavily on the type and
				quality of equipment.
				Outdated or poorly maintained rigs may not be able to drill deep enough or may take longer, increasing
				costs.
				Before finalizing a contractor, check what kind of drilling rigs they use (e.g., rotary, percussion, DTH
				rigs)
				and whether their equipment can handle the depth and soil/rock conditions in your region. Well-equipped
				contractors
				can complete the job more efficiently, with less risk of damage to property or incomplete drilling.</li>
			<li><span class="highlight">Reviews and Reputation:</span> Word of mouth and reviews are strong indicators
				of a contractor’s reliability. Ask neighbors, community members, or even local water authorities for
				feedback on contractors they have used. Positive reviews reflect not just successful borewell completion
				but also honesty in pricing, timeliness, and after-service support. A reputed contractor is also more
				likely to guide you correctly about casing pipes, motor installation, and long-term maintenance.</li>
